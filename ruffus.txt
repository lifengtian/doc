The python functions which do the actual work of each stage or task of a Ruffus pipeline are written by you.
The role of Ruffus is to make sure these functions are called in the right order, with the right parameters, running in parallel using multiprocessing if desired.
This step of the tutorial explains how these pipeline parameters are specified.

By letting Ruffus manage your pipeline parameters, you will get the following features for free:

        only out-of-date parts of the pipeline will be re-run
        multiple jobs can be run in parallel (on different processors if possible)
        pipeline stages can be chained together automatically

Ruffus is NOT ready for SGE/hadoop.
